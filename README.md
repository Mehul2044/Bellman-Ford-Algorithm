1) You can generate the dataset, i.e, graph matrix by running the `generate_data.py` file. It will generate randomly generated 5000 vertices and its weights.
2) Ensure you have gcc compiler installed in your system.
3) Use the command `gcc -pg main.c` to compile the code with debugging process.
4) Run the obtained executable file using `./a.out`.
5) Use the command `gprof` to generate a report of the program.
